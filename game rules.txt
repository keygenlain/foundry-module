Core Concepts 
What is a TTRPG? 
Read mousecamp.com/blog/what is-an-rpg for more information on  TTRPGs.  
The Dice Pool 
Spell and Steel uses a dice pool  system. A dice pool is a group of  six-sided dice (henceforth referred  to as d6s) which you gather to  attempt an action. Your pool  changes depending on your  relevant skill and attribute levels to  the action you are performing (skill  level 3, attribute score 3 = 6 dice) 
The gamemaster will determine the  Difficulty of a given action, and  thus what the Success Threshold  (ST) is. 
If a player does not have any levels  in a relevant skill, roll only with the  relevant attribute score and  subtract 1 from each result. 
Exploding Dice 
Exploding Dice are a system in  which players roll another d6 for  each time they roll a 6. If dice  explode more than 6 times in a  single pool, stop exploding. 
Success Threshold Guide 1 Trivial 
2 Easy 
3-4 Standard 
5 Hard 
6+ Legendary What is a Success? 
A success is a roll of 4 or above. The Focus System 
The Focus System is a system in  which players are rewarded with  “Focus Tokens” by the  
gamemaster. These allow players to  reroll a dice result that they are  unsatisfied with or add 1 die to a  roll. 
Character Progression 
At GM discretion, players can  receive a skill point. Also at GM  discretion, but rarer, players can  receive an Attribute Point. 
These points can be spent on Skill  and Attribute upgrades  
respectively.

Character Creation 
Whether you want to play a  Swashbuckling Rogue or a Knight  in Shining Armor, you'll need a  character sheet. This section will  guide you through Character  Creation. 
Determining Attributes 
Attributes are the basis of your  character, determining base skill  amounts as well as your health. To  determine your attributes, distribute  10 Attribute Points for Vigor,  Smarts, Agility, and Spirit. Each  attribute starts at 1, and they have a  maximum of 6. The starting points  (Points ensuring you start at 1 in  each attribute) do not count against  your 10 points. 
Determining Health 
Health is determined by Vigor × 5. Determining Mana 
Mana is determined by Spirit × 5. Starting Equipment 
Each player starts with 250 Silver to  spend on equipment and extra spells  beyond the two free spells. 
Skills List 
Vigor Agility Smarts Spirit Large Blades Short Blades Investigation Insight Brawl Long Blades Lore Persuade Athletics Acrobatics Polearms Faith Fortitude Stealth Ranged Arcana 

Determining Skills 
Blunt Sleight of  Hand 
Medicine Resolve 

Skills are determined during  
Character Creation via “skill  
points”. Each player starts with 10  skill points, and can distribute them  in a skill up to a level of 6 for each  skill. 
2 
Ride Survival Perform 
Intimidate
Ancestries 
Ancestries, such as Human, Elf,  Dwarf, etc, provide small bonuses to  attributes or skills. Choose one  ancestry during character creation. 
Starting Spells 
Each player may start with two spells  of their choice, provided they meet  the learning requirements. 
Ancestries 
Dwarf 
+1 Vigor  
+1 Fortitude  
Special Ability: Dwarf  Characters are immune to  any form of knockback.
Dwarves are a proud and ancient folk, said to  have been crafted from the very stone of the  mountains. They live for about 300-400 Years,  and are considered "Mature" at age 65. 
Known for their stoic demeanors and  unmatched craftmanship, they are highly sought  after both as soldiers and as smiths. 
While some see them as stubborn or insular for  living in their mountain homes and rarely  leaving; the Dwarves dispute this claim, insisting  that they have enough friends within the  mountains to last them a lifetime. 

3 
Ratfolk are a simple people who tend not to seek out  
adventure. It is rare that one is seen outside of their  
Dens, and thus many Ratfolk Adventurers have  
achieved a sort of "Celebrity" Status in the outside  
world. 
Ratfolk tend to live for about 60 years, and reach  
maturity around 10. 
Their dens are Matriarchal, with all rats in a den  
serving the "Mother Rat" of the den. 
Ratfolk 
+1 Agility  
+1 Stealth 
Special Ability: Turn  
1 Failed Pool into a  
Success per session.
4 
Humans are a short-lived folk who desire power  
above all else. 
Humans live for about 90 years, and reach  
maturity around 20. 
Human 
No Attribute Bonus  
+1 To any one skill  
Special Ability: Gain a  
temporary +1 boost to a  
attribute of your choice  
during combat. Ends after  
combat is over.
5 
It was not long ago that Orcs were treated with  
disdain by the "civilized" ancestries. They were  
cast out from society for millenia, and only 50  
years ago did the Church of the Holy Flame  
demand to the rulers of Araie that the Orcs be  
given rights. 
Now, Orcs are allowed to live in cities, and have  
integrated into armies. 
Orcs live for about 20 years longer than humans,  
though they reach maturity at the same age. Orc 
+1 Vigor  
+1 Brawl  
Special Ability: Let out a  
primal roar, invigorating  
your allies with a +1 boost  
to vigor for the rest of  
combat. The roar also scares  
away enemies.
6 
Elves live for about 2000 Years, being the longest  
lived ancestry. They live in the forests of the east  
of Araie, and punish harshly any who disturb  
these forests. 
They harbor a disdain for Dwarves, due to their  
industrious nature. 
Elf 
+1 Smarts  
+1 Ranged  
Special Ability: Due to your  
long life, you gain +2 dice on  
Lore rolls.
7 
Spells 
You may learn an amount of spells  equal to the combined levels of your  relevant skill to the spells and your  spirit attribute added together ×1.5  round up (this means that if you have 2  Arcana, 1 Faith, and 3 Spirit, you may  learn 8 Arcana Spells and 6 Faith  Spells). To learn a spell after character  creation, pay a character who knows  the spell to teach you. 
You may only learn and cast spells equal  to or below your max spell tier. 
Relevant Skill Max Spell Tier 1-2 1 
3-4 2 
5-6 3

Combat 
Combat takes place on a grid; with  each grid square representing 5  feet. 
Initiative 
Initiative in combat is determined  by who has the highest smarts and  spirit combined. Ties are resolved  by d6 roll-off. 
Actions 
On your turn, you can take: 
One Movement Action (Move an  amount of feet equal to your  
agility × 5 + 5) 
One Major Action (Attack, Cast  Spell) 
One Minor Action (Open Door,  Speak) 
Attack Rolls 
Your dice pool for attack is  
determined by your level in the  relevant combat skill. The amount  of successes required to hit your  enemy is always 3 unless stated  otherwise. For each roll in your  attack pool over the ST, deal an  9 
extra hit. 
Dealing Damage 
When dealing damage, you deal  your weapon's damage value minus  the enemy's armor value. The  reverse applies to enemies attacking  you. Magic damage ignores armor. 
All successful hits deal at least 1 Damage.Recovery 
Outside of combat, you may  recover fully by resting. Resting  takes 8 hours per rest. This  includes recovery of Mana as well as  your Health. 
Death 
Once you reach 0 HP, if you are  not tended to (minor action) by  another player or an enemy within  5 combat turns, you will die. Upon  tending, you gain 1 health, so as to  not knock you down  
again. 
Gamemaster's Section Awarding Focus Tokens 
The following are just two methods  of granting Focus Tokens: 
Roleplay Focus 
Reward players with Focus Tokens  for performing actions that are  suboptimal but advance the story  in an interesting way and/or are  fitting for their characters. 
Milestone Focus 
Grant Focus Tokens to the entire  party for completing story  
milestones (escaping prison,  catching a spy, etc). 

Creating Monsters 
Monster sheets are the same as  character sheets; with the following  differences: 
1. Monsters have more or less  points than players for  
attributes and skills depending  on their intended power. 
2. Monsters do not have  
Ancestries 
3. There is no Attribute or Skill  cap for monsters 
4. Monsters can have Tags, which  give them special  
vulnerabilities. 
Optional Rule: MVP Tokens 
MVP Tokens are an optional rule  in which at the end of a session,  Players may vote for their “MVP”  of the party. This MVP then  receives three Focus Tokens. If you  received an MVP Token in a  session, you may not receive one in  the next.

10 

Running Humanoid  
Monsters 
One must remember that  
Humanoid Monsters are rather  intelligent, and as such, have  enough reasoning to know that  taking hostages is a good idea if  they want to live. Perhaps a  Skeleton will run up to a downed  player to stabilize them, only to  take them hostage? There are many  things that you can do with the  knowledge that many monsters are  as smart and capable of reasoning  as humans. 
Opposed Rolls 
 If making an Opposed Roll, have  the GM decide what stat the player  rolls and what stat the NPC rolls.  The winner is whoever has more  successes. In case of a tie, whoever  has the higher skill wins. In case  skills are tied, roll a D6. If 4-6, the  player wins. If 1-3, the NPC wins.  Focus tokens may be used to reroll  Opposed Rolls. 
If the Opposed Roll is Player  Versus Player and both the roll and  skills are tied, roll 1d6. If 1-3, the  defending player wins. If 4-6, the  initiating player wins.  
Status Effects 
Status Effects include: Blinded  (Affected character cannot see until  cured), Burning (Take 1 damage  per turn for 3 turns), and Poisoned  (Take 1 damage per turn until  cured)

Religion and Gods of  Araie 
Araie has many Gods, but the most  powerful by far are known as the Three Flame-Keepers. The Three  Flame-Keepers are named Armos,  Fredda, and Treyas. 
Armos is the God of War, cleaving  those who stand in the way of the  Holy Flame. 
Fredda is the God of Truthfulness,  seeing through even the most poker faced liars. 
Treyas is the most powerful of the  three, being the God of the Holy  Flame itself. 
These are the Gods who The  Church of the Holy Flame worship,  but there are also other gods; such as  Urgnash the Orc-Father and  Nibbums the Mother Rat.
